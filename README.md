Hi, my name is Gena Rusetski. I am 31 years old, divorced, no kids, currently located in Larnaca, Cyprus. I've been in commercial development for more than 8 years, and the last 7 of them as a frontend developer. During this time I have gained a rich and varied experience, but my biggest interest is developing advanced and quality web applications. I love my job, I am pretty good at it, and I love to perform it well. Also, I regularly spend time learning and practicing new tools and ideas.

My projects:

https://github.com/ant478/it-roleplay - old pet project made in 2019.

https://github.com/ant478/code-samples - sandbox for trying new ideas and studying stuff.

https://github.com/ant478/web-components - my experiments with web components.

https://github.com/ant478/push-notifications - web service for storing webPush subscriptions and sending notifications.
